# map-data-visualization
A Python application for distance finding on Dartmouth's campus. 

This application was built using a breadth-first-search algorithm and animated using Dartmouth's CS1 library. 

Run `map_plot.py` for an interactive view of Dartmouth's campus. Click on a vertex and then drag around the map to find the shortest path to any location on campus. 

Have fun!
